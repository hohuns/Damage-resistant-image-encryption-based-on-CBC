## Mini Project for EE4215 Cybersecurity Technology

To develop a “Damage resistant image encryption based on CBCBitcoin” application using Python.

## Project summary
Noise occurs when the transmission, device errors or sabotage etc. This project develops an anti-noise encryption method by using Quick Response (QR) Code. Cipher block chaining (CBC) is chosen because of its fast and effective characteristics for encrypting images. However, encrypted data is sensitive to damage. QR code can be restored even if a maximum of 30 percent of the code is damaged. This advantage provided insight into noise-resistant encryption.
